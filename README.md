# BookStoreManagement
In the fall of 2023, I led and contributed to the development of a Bookstore Management Web Application, enhancing the efficiency of book rental processes for a local bookstore. Utilizing PHP, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Apache, and MySQL, our team created a user-friendly platform with search, registration, and membership management features. My role encompassed planning, coordinating with the team, and front-end development, culminating in a successful presentation and excellent feedback from our professor.
